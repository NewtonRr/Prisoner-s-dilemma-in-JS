# Prisoner-s-dilemma-in-JS
A simple program based on the game “Prisoner's dilemma” made entire with JavaScript

It's possible to change the “Players” script to create more advanced bots who can make more points.
I got the idea by watching the video “What The Prisoner's Dilemma Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything” from the YouTube Chanel “veritasium”.

The code is pretty simple and can be upgraded to a more powerful version.
